* WONT multiple directories - just start the script multiple times
* DONE add mac support
- notifications working
- inotifywait..
* DONE add logging
* DONE Log timestamp of last operation
* WONT support stashes
* WONT might want to use git-toolbelt
* DONE Automatically add PWD name in logging so we don't have to add it everywhere
* DONE NB commit messages are not correct yet
* DONE BUG: Cannot stop with ctrl c anymore <- bisect, kijken wanneer het weer werkt
* DONE Dont warn every time when network is down
* DONE Limit number and/or size of newly added files!
* WONT sync when network comes online (nmcli -t general status) // doen we dat niet al?
* DONE print messages to stdout and errors to stderr
** caller can redirect to logfile themselves
** Maybe just silence git with 2>/dev/null
* TODO Use git -c?
* TODO tray icon met status
** Met mogelijkheid tot klikken om log te openen; folder onder sync te openen; ...?
** linux: https://sourceforge.net/p/yad-dialog/wiki/NotificationIcon/
** Mac:  https://github.com/matryer/bitbar#writing-plugins
** Mac optie 2: https://www.macstories.net/mac/textbar-puts-your-text-into-the-menu-bar/a
* TESTING
** STARTED Use BATS
** Use docker to test linux
- merge and conflicts
- rebase and conflicts (how?)
- push/fetch
** NB what happens when we stage files??
* QUESTION: Really fetch every minute? Maybe use counter for that?
* TODO one main process with forks for multiple dirs -> one taskbar icon
** TODO when we have that: keep processes running on error; waiting until error is resolved
* Homebrew install with requirements ;)
* Sync passwords and ps project
* AARGH counting max_files doesnt work or at least not stop the script
* also after sync issues I still get the message "Local and remote still differ after sync. Please check."
